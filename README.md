# Madrebo-Bank-Management-System
Bank management system

This is an online bank management system developed by two programmers, @ian2423 and @ryantonga. You may find this project on either one of our repositories under the same name.
The premise of this project is to develop a simulation of an online ATM.
It's a java-based program that utilizes SQL to manage and convey tables in their respective functions.
We used a variety of resources, including codeforinterview on youtube, java Oracle, and, of course, chatGPT for syntax purposes.
The source code for each class is listed in each class folder that have been committed in this repositories.
Hope you enjoy!
